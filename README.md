# Welcome!

This is the place for documentation on requests within Wii no Ma! As development and reverse engineering progresses, we will continue to correct information.

Wii no Ma was a service in which users could view videos, play and purchase movies, order physical items, use their DSi for movies and coupons, and be stormed with numerous advertisements by vendors. Additionally, a Rooms/a Company Parade existed so that you could seek out vendors directly and interact.

There are three known versions:

| Version | Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| v0 \(or v512\) | Initial release. For unknown reasons, this version was also re-released under the version v512. Nothing differs asides from the version. |
| v770 | A major rewrite, adding a more refined room style. Internals are majorly rewritten and more stable. |
| v1025 | Introduces the concept of the theatre, a separate room only for paid movies. Introduces a shop within. Much of v1025 is similar to v770, both internally and in format. |

{% hint style="info" %}
The majority of this documentation centers around v1025. Ongoing efforts are being made to support v770 as well. Where possible, a note such as this one will appear.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
v0/v512 is extremely difficult to work with, individually selecting bytes in strings for all calls, and separating core logic. We will most likely not document or restore this version.
